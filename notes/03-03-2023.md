- HDD transfer instead of PCIE bar 
  - Memcpy HtoD 
- Write into command queue on NIC 
- Big long bouy 
- In this case we're copying most of a command over, wait until we tell you to do this 
- Abstract addresses are where is the line for that command that we want to reference 
- Fetchable memory on the bridge range 
- Three elements 
  - Address of pcie device 
  - Functions, physical/virtual, can be two like HDMI, networks only do one 
    - Networks have a one physiccal, the virtual has many, the virtual are just used for virtual machines, don't get confused by these 
- talk about all this open house 
- include addressing 
- Choose numbers to populate window space 
- finding the proper window range- will negate errors, 
\


- Don't want to create a sub link list on the GPU 
- 4 leaf clo-node-ver
- Cpu -> nic, GPU data addr of nodes, GPU data size, all of this is a big linked list of commands 
- We want GPU -> Nic directly, 
- CPU -> GPU (A1,A2,A3,A4), CPU -> GPU (Size1,size2,size3,size4), CPU -> GPU (addr1,addr2,addr3,addr4)
- ^ we're pulling information from the CPU out of linked list to Tuples (arrays). then sending that information over to the GPU 
  - Then the GPU can send this over to the NIC
\


The crux of this is the format that we're gonna put the data into. Hash tables and hash functions. 
\


(A1, Size, Addr)
- Addr = network IP address basically, there's also the memory address for the PCIE bus that has the command that we're going to populate
- A1, node that it's going to 
- Letter analogy 
- Finish addressing it, put the data in it
- But NOW you need to know how to get to the post office 
\


1. Figure out data that's going in there 
2. Create a structure for how the letter is
3. Create a structure to tell the NIC how to find the post office 
4. Create a structure to put the data in? 
\


Where in the NIC bar is the letter that I am meant to finish filling out? 
\


CPU -> GPU 
two methods 
1. cuda memcpy htod (host to device)
   1. this figures out how to place stuff in the BAR 
   2. Use this for CPU -> GPU, need all the other stuff for getting the GPU to write to a PCIE device (the NIC in this case)
2. write to PCIE bar 
\


GPU -> PCIE 
- Find in your GPU the PCIE device address 
- Finding the actual BAR memory address is a nice addon for the FUNCTION address, function address is how you write to things 
- If you try to write a NIC to a specific BAR address that's what a driver does 
\


1. CPU -> GPU is PCIE transfer, 
   1. GPU data addr of nodes, GPU data size, all of this is a big linked list of commands 
   2. In a tuple form 
   3. GPU direct
2. GPU does work and fill in the address, now we have this stuff in nice form for the NIC 
   1. 
3. GPU sends commands to the NIC 


Pretend this last stage ^ for now and then we can go from there. 
\


The essential question right now is getting a good data structure for the GPU and making a special function called export that turns
data structures into something that makes sense for the GPU.
